### Javier Portorreal

I want to work on a project that revolves around web development. I will most likley choose to continue to work on Submitty. Ive been contributing for almost 2 years now and I would like to wrap up a few features I have been working on. I graduate this semester and I think it would be the best use of my time. Joining a new project means I have to onboard all over again. I am currently working on a huge change to Late Days that is still a WIP so I plan to finish that.

One idea I have is to continue working on a web application that was started in my Software Design and Documentation class that is still in very early development. I would also like to try and work on a project relating to Machine Learning as I have no experience, but am very interested in learning. 

### Benjamin Xu

I would like to work on a project that has to do with maintaining and querying a database. It 
could be a tool that is used on different sets of data or just an application/website. Another
idea is some kind of way to simplify more complex interfaces.

### Gavin He

My idea is to implement a visual programming tool that uses block codes. It works like the one we did in part 5 of lab 1, but we can do more things with it. For example, to achieve more complecated logic and structures such as for loop, while loop and even recursion.
